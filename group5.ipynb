    "# Energy Anomaly & Power Theft Detection System  \n",
    "### A Data Science Research Framework for Grid Irregularity Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Electricity utilities in **Kenya** face significant operational and financial challenges arising from irregular energy consumption, meter tampering, and unauthorized electricity usage. In emerging markets, including Kenya, energy theft contributes to substantial revenue losses and increased strain on distribution infrastructure. Despite the availability of high-frequency smart meter data, many utilities lack structured analytical frameworks capable of distinguishing legitimate variability from suspicious consumption behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project develops an end-to-end data science framework for detecting abnormal electricity usage patterns and potential power theft using time-series consumption data, environmental context, and scheduled outage information.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate a realistic operational environment, the project constructs a multi-household electricity dataset derived from high-resolution power measurements. Each simulated household exhibits natural consumption variability, while selected households are injected with synthetic theft-like behavior patterns such as sudden sustained drops and abnormal load shape distortions. This enables controlled evaluation of anomaly detection performance in the absence of real-world labeled theft data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system integrates three major data components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Electricity Consumption Data (Core Signal)**  \n",
    "   Minute-level power and voltage measurements aggregated into structured daily behavioral features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Weather Data (Contextual Adjustment Layer)**  \n",
    "   Temperature, precipitation, and wind speed variables used to contextualize legitimate demand variability and reduce false anomaly signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scheduled Outage Information (Operational Filter)**  \n",
    "   Official maintenance interruptions structured into daily indicators to prevent misclassification of planned supply interruptions as suspicious activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project transitions from raw time-series data to a structured anomaly detection pipeline that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Engineers behavioral and volatility-based consumption features  \n",
    "- Adjusts for environmental and operational context  \n",
    "- Applies unsupervised anomaly detection techniques  \n",
    "- Assigns quantitative risk scores to each simulated household  \n",
    "- Generates structured fraud investigation case exports  \n",
    "\n",
    "The final output is not merely a binary classification, but a ranked list of high-risk energy usage cases supported by explainable indicators and contextual metadata. This research framework demonstrates how utilities can leverage consumption analytics to move from reactive fraud investigation to proactive anomaly intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, this work presents a scalable blueprint for data-driven energy irregularity detection, combining time-series modeling, contextual feature engineering, and anomaly scoring to support operational grid resilience."

    "## Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Electricity utilities operate in environments where revenue protection and grid stability are critical to long-term sustainability. One of the major operational challenges faced by utilities—particularly in emerging economies—is the presence of non-technical losses arising from electricity theft, meter tampering, illegal connections, and irregular consumption behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Energy theft reduces utility revenues, increases operational costs, and creates uneven load stress on the distribution network. In addition to financial loss, unauthorized consumption can compromise grid safety and reliability by introducing unpredictable demand patterns and infrastructure strain. Traditional fraud detection approaches rely heavily on manual inspections, customer reporting, or rule-based heuristics, which are reactive, resource-intensive, and often inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the widespread adoption of smart meters, utilities now collect high-frequency electricity consumption data. However, the availability of large volumes of time-series data does not automatically translate into actionable fraud detection. Many utilities lack structured analytical systems capable of distinguishing legitimate consumption variability (e.g., seasonal changes, weather-driven demand shifts, or scheduled outages) from suspicious or abnormal patterns indicative of theft.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core business problem addressed in this project is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> How can utilities leverage electricity consumption data, environmental context, and operational schedules to proactively detect abnormal usage patterns and prioritize high-risk cases for investigation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the challenge involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identifying irregular consumption behavior without relying on fully labeled theft data.\n",
    "- Reducing false positives caused by legitimate demand fluctuations or scheduled service interruptions.\n",
    "- Transforming raw anomaly scores into structured, explainable investigation cases.\n",
    "- Creating a scalable, data-driven framework that supports operational fraud detection teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project addresses the gap by developing an integrated anomaly detection system that combines consumption behavior analysis, contextual environmental features, and operational outage filters to produce ranked theft-risk cases suitable for further investigation."
